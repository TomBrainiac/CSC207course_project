1. A description of the problem domain
   The problem domain we actually phase building is the chat system. 
   We want to build a platform that allows users to chat by text and voice through private chats, 
   group chats and so on. The software will be categorized as social, and at the same time, it 
   will focus on the chatting system, whose fundamental feature is the complete anonymity, which allows 
   the user to talk freely with strangers about any topic, which can be completely unrelated to the real life. 
   Through this kind of chatting with strangers, detoxify loneliness and isolation and find a listener for 
   the stories you usually can't tell in the real life.

2. A high-level description of application 
   1. In the user chat interface, we allow users to send text and voice messages as well as pictures. 
      These features can be used in both group and private chats.
   2. Each logged-in user will have his/her own homepage, but the user will not be able to choose his/her own profile picture, 
      the software will keep them the same, the user doesn't need to use his/her real name, 
      nor provide any personal information in his/her homepage, like age, education, location, etc.,
      he/she will be able to start chatting by choosing his/her gender and sexual orientation.
   3. In the profile, he can upload text or pictures to post, each post must cover the category tags provided by the software, 
      and other users can also see this by clicking on the user's avatar to visit the user's homepage.
   4. the software will have "plazas", they will be a collection of each user's posts, and users themselves can narrow down 
      their posts by filtering the tags #.
