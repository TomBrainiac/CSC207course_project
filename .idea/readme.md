1. A description of the problem domain
   The problem domain we actually phase building is the chat system. 
   We want to build a platform that allows users to chat by text through private chats, 
   group chats and so on. The software will be categorized as social media, and at the same time, it 
   will focus on the chatting system, whose fundamental feature is the complete anonymity, which allows 
   the user to talk freely with strangers about any topic, which can be completely unrelated to the real life. 
   Through this kind of chatting with strangers, detoxify loneliness and isolation and find a listener for 
   the stories you usually can't tell in the real life.

2. A high-level description of application 
   1. In the user chat interface, users can only send text which is unrelated to their real life.
   These features can be used in both group and private chats.
   2. Each logged-in user will have his/her own homepage, but the user will not be able to choose his/her own profile picture. 
   Our system will choose a ridiculous homepage or personal information for the user for 24 hours. After 24 hours,
   the system will create a completely new homepage and personal information for him/her. Ridiculous means the information system
   provided will contradict to real world/history.
   3. In the profile, he can upload text or pictures to post, each post must cover the category tags provided by the software, 
      and other users can also see this by clicking on the user's avatar to visit the user's homepage. 
   users are freely to discover others post and likes their post. The posted text or pictures can only exist for 24 hours, 
   after 24 hours, your homepage will be completely renewed by system. Each week the system will publish the most liked post in 24 hours.
   4. the software will have "plazas", they will be a collection of each user's posts, and users themselves can narrow down 
      their posts by filtering the tags #.
